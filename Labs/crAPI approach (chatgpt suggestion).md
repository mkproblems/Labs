The OWASP crAPI challenges vary in difficulty, but they generally align with common API security issues from the **OWASP API Top 10**. Hereâ€™s a rough breakdown based on difficulty levels:

**How to Approach crAPI Challenges Efficiently**  
âœ… Start with **BOLA & authentication flaws** (they are the easiest).  
âœ… Keep track of what works & what doesnâ€™t (helps speed up solving future challenges).  
âœ… If you're stuck for more than your set time limit, check relevant API security concepts.  
âœ… After solving, research real-world API bug reports for similar vulnerabilities.

### **Beginner (15-30 min)**

ðŸ”¹ **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)** â€“ Testing for unauthorized access to other users' data.  
ðŸ”¹ **Broken User Authentication** â€“ Exploiting weak authentication mechanisms.  
ðŸ”¹ **Excessive Data Exposure** â€“ Checking API responses for sensitive data leaks.

### **Intermediate (30-60 min)**

ðŸ”¹ **Mass Assignment** â€“ Manipulating API request parameters to escalate privileges.  
ðŸ”¹ **Broken Function Level Authorization** â€“ Trying unauthorized admin actions.  
ðŸ”¹ **Security Misconfigurations** â€“ Finding exposed API endpoints or misconfigured headers.  
ðŸ”¹ **Rate Limiting & DoS Attacks** â€“ Testing how the API handles excessive requests.

### **Advanced (60-90 min)**

ðŸ”¹ **JWT Manipulation & Token Attacks** â€“ Exploiting JWT flaws (e.g., weak signing keys, algorithm tampering).  
ðŸ”¹ **SSRF via API Calls** â€“ Finding server-side request forgery vulnerabilities.  
ðŸ”¹ **GraphQL API Hacking** â€“ Discovering misconfigured or over-permissive GraphQL queries.  
ðŸ”¹ **Chained Attacks (BOLA + IDOR + Mass Assignment, etc.)** â€“ Combining multiple vulnerabilities for full account takeover.
